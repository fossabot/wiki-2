Named after the smallest (and most venemous) sea slug in the world _Glaucus
bennettae_, glaucus is an independent, open-source, general-purpose,
bleeding-edge, rolling-release, source-based Linux® distribution based on musl
libc and toybox, built from scratch around the suckless philosophy without
sacrificing convenience.


Just like the animal, glaucus has the following:

## ceras
A single package

## cerata
Multiple packages

## cluster
A single group of packages

## clusters
Multiple groups of packages

## cyst
A single package dependency

## cysts
Multiple package dependencies

## envenomate
The build script

## species
The different available flavors/versions of glaucus

## atlanticus
The main version of glaucus available, built with the most extreme performance
optimization flags available and consists only of packages required to get a
sway WM to work (a wayland only distribution or with minimal Xorg cerata
required to get sway to work).

## bennettae
The smallest version of glaucus available, built with the most extreme size
optimization flags available and consists only of packages required to get it to
boot (should be under 10 MB in size).

## thompsoni
Will be kept as a secret for now.

## albino
A libre version of glaucus atlanticus that hasn't been tainted with proprietary
software (there exists a white albino non-pigmented glaucus atlanticus, see the
image below):

## fleet
Distributions based on glaucus combined

## genus
A single project forked from glaucus

## genera
Multiple projects forked from glaucus

## radula
The package manager

## sac
A single directory that holds the build result of a single `ceras`

## sacs
Multiple directories that hold the build result of multiple `cerata`

## venom
A single directory that contains the final xz tarball of a `sac` along with a
checksum file that hashes its contents, both of which are obtained after running
`envenomate`.

## voyager
A glaucus tester or a ceras maintainer

## voyagers
Multiple glaucus testers of multiple cerata maintainers

## TODO
A custom screenfetch-like command that shows an ASCII image of the animal with X
number of cerata (with `X` being the actual number of cerata installed in
glaucus, meaning that the ASCII image changes whenever a cerata is
added/removed) is in the TODO list for enthusiasts' bragging rights.
