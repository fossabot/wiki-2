# vi. Prerequisites
This wiki/book is intended to be a comprehensive guide on how to build glaucus,
but since the build scripts are fully automated (with the exception of running
the scripts themselves) there are no specific prerequisites needed in order to
build glaucus.

That said, and regardless of the automated nature of glaucus, everything will be
thoroughly explained from a beginner's point of view (those of you who read
DOTSLASHLINUX's articles will know what I mean).
