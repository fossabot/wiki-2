# iv. glaucus and Standards
glaucus tries to follow the Linux standards as closely as possible:

1.   [POSIX.1-2017](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/)
2.   [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) Version 3.0](
     https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/index.html)

glaucus doesn't follow the Linux Standard Base (LSB) standard as closely as the
above two standards, because it relies on lighter and more performant
alternatives for basic software.
